# odin_tictactoe
Tic Tac toe game made in Ruby as part of The Odin Project. The original was done around March 2021, with the refactored version being done in July 2021 after
I took a few months away from Ruby to study Python for school. While I'm sure there's still a lot of areas that could be improved (not having to hardcode the 
win conditions for one),I was very happy to see how much cleaner it is relative to my original tictactoe project.
